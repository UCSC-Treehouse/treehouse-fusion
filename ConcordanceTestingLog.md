# Concordance Testing for Treehouse Fusion pipeline

## star-fusion:0.0.2 -> treehouse-fusion:0.1.0
To test concordance between fusion pipeline versions, I ran six Treehouse samples with confirmed hits. The filtered fusion hits were identical between these two versions. The order of the fusions for TH01_0122_S01 was different, but otherwise the hits were identical.

TH01_0119_S01
TH01_0122_S01
TH01_0125_S01
TH01_0129_S01
TH01_0130_S01
TH01_0132_S01
